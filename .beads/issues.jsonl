{"id":"saasquatch-3xs","title":"improve deals management","description":"Fix Create Deal button in New Deal popup not working.\n\nRoot causes identified and fixed:\n1. Button component missing cursor-pointer - Tailwind v4 preflight sets buttons to cursor:default\n2. Deal Name field was using controlled input but form state wasn't tracking properly\n\nChanges:\n- src/components/ui/button.tsx: Added cursor-pointer and disabled:cursor-not-allowed to button variants\n- src/components/CreateDealDialog.tsx: \n  - Changed Deal Name field from controlled to uncontrolled input using useRef\n  - Added manual validation for all required fields\n  - Removed Zod schema validation since form fields were managed externally\n  - Used useId() for unique element IDs\n\nTested: Successfully created a deal via browser automation, received 201 response from API.","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2026-01-01T15:22:53.109185Z","created_by":"mikej","updated_at":"2026-01-03T20:42:43.384299Z","closed_at":"2026-01-03T20:42:43.384299Z","close_reason":"Closed"}
{"id":"saasquatch-gow","title":"Deals not appearing in pipeline kanban board after creation","description":"Fix deals not appearing in pipeline kanban board.\n\nRoot cause: The deals API response was missing the `stageId` field at the top level of each deal object. The API returned `stage.id` but the frontend `PipelineKanban` component filtered deals by `deal.stageId`.\n\nFix: Added `stageId: d.stageId` to the API response in `api.tenant.$tenant.deals.ts`.\n\nVerified: After fix, deals correctly appear in the kanban columns (LEAD, MEETING, etc.) with proper counts and potential values.","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2026-01-03T20:52:17.555104Z","created_by":"mikej","updated_at":"2026-01-03T21:04:36.435084Z","closed_at":"2026-01-03T21:04:36.435084Z","close_reason":"Closed"}
{"id":"saasquatch-qlo","title":"Start subscriptions from invoice line items when invoice is paid","description":"When an invoice is paid and contains line items with product plan references, automatically create and activate subscriptions for those products.\n\n## Current State\n- Invoice line items only store: description, quantity, unitPrice, total\n- Quote UI collects productId/planId but discards them when submitting\n- Existing subscription activation only works when invoice.subscriptionId is already set\n\n## Implementation\n1. Add productPlanId to QuoteLineItem and InvoiceLineItem interfaces\n2. Update CreateQuoteDialog to include planId as productPlanId when creating quotes\n3. Update invoice payment handler to create subscriptions from line items with productPlanId\n4. Ensure quote-to-invoice conversion preserves productPlanId\n\n## Edge Cases\n- Multiple line items with different product plans = create multiple subscriptions\n- Line item with plan customer already subscribes to = skip or error\n- Manual invoices (not from quotes) with product plans","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2026-01-07T19:20:49.85422Z","created_by":"mikej","updated_at":"2026-01-07T19:28:40.906587Z","closed_at":"2026-01-07T19:28:40.906587Z","close_reason":"Closed"}
