{"id":"saasquatch-3xs","title":"improve deals management","description":"Fix Create Deal button in New Deal popup not working.\n\nRoot causes identified and fixed:\n1. Button component missing cursor-pointer - Tailwind v4 preflight sets buttons to cursor:default\n2. Deal Name field was using controlled input but form state wasn't tracking properly\n\nChanges:\n- src/components/ui/button.tsx: Added cursor-pointer and disabled:cursor-not-allowed to button variants\n- src/components/CreateDealDialog.tsx: \n  - Changed Deal Name field from controlled to uncontrolled input using useRef\n  - Added manual validation for all required fields\n  - Removed Zod schema validation since form fields were managed externally\n  - Used useId() for unique element IDs\n\nTested: Successfully created a deal via browser automation, received 201 response from API.","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2026-01-01T15:22:53.109185Z","created_by":"mikej","updated_at":"2026-01-03T20:42:43.384299Z","closed_at":"2026-01-03T20:42:43.384299Z","close_reason":"Closed"}
